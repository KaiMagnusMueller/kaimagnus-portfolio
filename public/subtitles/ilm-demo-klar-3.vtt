Hello and welcome to Icon Library manager. In this video I will show you how to create and update icon libraries by importing svg files. 

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000 
First, let’s import our files.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000 
I will use the carbon icon set for this video, which you can get on GitHub or npm.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000 
For this demo I’m installing an older version, so we can see the update process later.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000 
Navigate to the folder called „svg“ and accept. This will take a second.

00:22.942 --> 00:30.942 
Now, ILM displays all files in the selected folder and any subfolders and we can create our library.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000 
The plugin automatically turned all icons into components. As you can see on the left, the original folder structure is preserved. 

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000 
Let’s publish the library.

00:49.646 --> 00:53.698 
In my design file I can now enable the library and insert icons. Great!

01:07.105 --> 01:16.105 
Time to go back to the library and update it with the latest version of carbon icons. I’ve already downloaded them in to this folder.

01:22.129 --> 01:26.129 
Make sure to always select the same folder when importing icons, so ILM can track changed icons.

01:27.095 --> 01:35.911 
Now we get a list of all changes that have occurred between the old version in my file and the one I just imported.

01:36.949 --> 01:41.495 
Green are new icons and blue changed.

01:41.756 --> 01:44.280 
Here are some more

01:48.149 --> 01:52.571 
Let’s apply the changes

01:54.489 --> 02:01.111 
As you can see the list got a bit larger, because there are about 300 new icons.

02:04.112 --> 02:12.547 
ILM also undated the changed icons. So in the library update, they are marked correctly as „modified“.

02:27.015 --> 02:35.015 
So now we can update the Figma library and as you can see, some components were changed.

02:36.688 --> 02:39.808 
Thank you for watching!
