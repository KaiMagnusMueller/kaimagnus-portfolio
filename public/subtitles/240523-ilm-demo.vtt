Hello and welcome to Icon Library manager or ILM for short

00:04.598 --> 00:09.561
In this video, I want to show how you can create and update icon libraries by importing SVG files

00:10.480 --> 00:12.825
As an example icon set, I'm going to use carbon icons for this video which you can get on GitHub or npm. But it works with all icon files that you can download as SVGs.

00:13.070 --> 00:19.226
To get started, I navigate to the 'svg' folder, that contains all the icon files

00:20.045 --> 00:24.000
I’m installing an older version right now to demonstrate the update process later

00:25.150 --> 00:31.295
If there are a lot of icons, the import process can take a few seconds…

00:33.476 --> 00:39.374
Once its done, ILM displays all files it found in the folder and I can create the library

00:41.870 --> 00:49.669
The plugin automatically created components for all icons and the original folder structure is preserved in their names 

00:50.440 --> 00:51.800
Let’s publish the library…

00:58.889 --> 01:02.849
In my design file, I can now enable the library and insert a few icons

01:14.305 --> 01:14.645
Great! Let's head back to the library file to show you the update process.

01:16.475 --> 01:22.475
I've already prepared the currently latest version of carbon icons here and you can learn how to use npm get the latest version in the post below. 

01:22.475 --> 01:28.475
You can also try this with other sets, like Heroicons and so on. The process is the same.

01:26.373 --> 01:34.269
It is important to always select the same folder when importing icons, in my case that is the 'svg' folder from earlier. That way ILM can keep track of changed icons. 

01:35.610 --> 01:41.970
Now here is the magic moment. ILM shows a list of all changes the carbon icons team made since the version I imported. Imagine this could have been a few months ago.

01:43.243 --> 01:47.752
If I scroll down a bit there are icons highlighted in green if they are new and blue if there were changes.

01:49.381 --> 01:50.043
Here are some more

01:51.749 --> 01:54.839
Ok, seems good. Let’s apply the changes…

02:06.232 --> 02:11.505
Because there are about 300 new icons, the list got a bit larger, but it's still alphabetically sorted.

02:12.500 --> 02:18.960
What's really handy when working with this long term, is the fact that ILM doesn't replace any components. 

02:16.500 --> 02:24.960
It only touches the ones that were actually changed, so when I publish this library update to my team, they show up correctly as 'modified' without any removed or duplicate components.

02:30.387 --> 02:32.587
Now I can update the library…

02:33.067 --> 02:39.698
If you look closely, you can see some icons changing slightly 

02:41.244 --> 02:51.283
You can use the same process for whichever icons you are using, be it your internal set or otherwise and all your designs will stay up to date. There is need to manually update icons and there will be no more duplicate files or confusion about what library to use in your team. 

02:49.357 --> 02:51.283
Thank you for watching!
