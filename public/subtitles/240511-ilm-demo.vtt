WEBVTT - Made with VTT Creator

Hello and welcome to Icon Library manager

00:04.598 --> 00:09.561
In this video, I will show you how to create and update icon libraries by importing svg files

00:10.480 --> 00:12.825
First, let’s import our files.

00:13.070 --> 00:19.226
I will use the carbon icon set for this video, which you can get on GitHub or npm

00:20.045 --> 00:24.000
For this demo I’m installing an older version, so we can see the update process later

00:25.150 --> 00:31.295
Navigate to the folder called „svg“ and accept. This will take a second.

00:33.476 --> 00:39.374
Now, ILM displays all files in the selected folder and any subfolders and we can create our library

00:41.870 --> 00:49.669
The plugin automatically turned all icons into components. As you can see on the left, the original folder structure is preserved. 

00:50.440 --> 00:51.800
Let’s publish the library

00:58.889 --> 01:02.849
Now I can enable the library in my design file and start inserting icons

01:14.305 --> 01:14.645
Great!

01:16.475 --> 01:22.475
Time to head back to our library file and update it with the latest version of carbon icons, which I've already prepared here

01:26.373 --> 01:32.269
Make sure to always select the same folder when importing icons, so ILM can track changed icons

01:35.610 --> 01:41.970
Now, we get a list of all changes that have occurred between the old version in my file and the one I just imported

01:43.243 --> 01:45.752
Green are new icons and blue changed

01:49.381 --> 01:50.043
Here are some more

01:51.749 --> 01:52.839
Let’s apply the changes

02:06.232 --> 02:11.505
As you can see the list got a bit larger, because there are about 300 new icons

02:12.500 --> 02:21.960
Because ILM doesn't replace any icons, but instead updates the ones that are changed, the component update panel markes them correctly as changed

02:30.387 --> 02:32.587
Now we can update our Figma file

02:33.067 --> 02:43.698
Since ILM only applies changes to components where necessary, we get clean library updates and the component update panel only shows icons modified in the source folder.

02:44.244 --> 02:48.125
If you look closely, you can see our component update was successful

02:49.357 --> 02:51.283
Thank you for watching!
