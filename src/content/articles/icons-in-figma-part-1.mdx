There are many different approaches on how to handle icons in Figma and in this series of posts, I want to discuss some approaches on how to get icons and how to use them in projects. All of this is founded on my learnings while working extensively with icons in a team of designers in the last couple of years.

In this post we're going to learn where to get icons. In the next few posts, I want to discuss how to use icons in components and designs, how to construct icon placeholder components and my plugin that simplifies icon library management. The plugin was built to enable the currently best way to handle icons in Figma that my team and I settled on. It gives design teams flexibility and independence, a robust update flow using standard Figma features and works with virtually any icon library that provides SVG icon files.

But let's do it step by step.

## Plugins

A pretty popular approach to add icons to a design is via first party plugins like Google Material Symbols or the Streamline Icons Plugin. These official plugins are frequently updated with the latest icons in their respective set and are generally trustworthy. There are not that many of them and here I want to highlight the two mentioned above.

### Google Material Symbols (GMS)

Since the Material Symbols icon set https://fonts.google.com/icons has grown to over 3 thousand glyphs with a wide number of customizations (in part thanks to variable fonts) it can be quite a challenge to manage them. [^1] To make this easier, Google created the Material Symbols Plugin. It provides probably the best interface out of all the icon plugins included are all the parameters Material Symbols uses, like outlined and rounded syles, fills and stroke weight. Choosing different options also updates the previews, so WYSIWYG. The search uses a tag system so searching for "para" for example not only turns up the "paragraph" icon, but also the icons for alignment and indentation, which is quite handy.

When an icon is selected in the plugin, it is inserted at the current viewport center, according to the current settings. If the parameter options are updated an icon is selected in Figma, it is updated as well. It will also swap glyphs when we click on another icon. This comes in pretty handy, since we can update icons in place instead of deleting and creating new ones whenever we change something.

### Streamline Icons

Streamline is a pretty famous if not the most notable independent icon set. And therefore a dedicated plugin is only natural. Streamline is also very extensive and there are many different icon sets of varying size spread across nine different themes. Streamline is not a single icon set, but a whole series of icon sets in different styles. All of those are listed in the plugin, and a few of the basic sets have a passable amount of free icons. I wish they would be grouped a bit better, as it stands, the "Core" series is listed four times, each of the styles (solid, line, duo, etc…) are listed separately. The plugon is not as pretty as Googles' and a bit slower while inserting icons but is still good. It is lacking in features though, and unfortunately doesn't replace selected icons. It has a search that is not tagged, but manages to do a decent job by inserting a group layer in each icon with faux tags in its name. This does bloat the layer list sometimes, but makes it possible to search by "tags" natively inside Figma.

I have one gripe though. Instead of providing icons as outlined paths, here we get the raw, unchanged paths. This means, using the icons in button components with different sizes is not really ergonomic. Shrinking the icons, in an instance swap for example, will result in unnatural thick stroke proportions. This is an issue with all sets I tested where icons have lines, only the solid variants were fine.

### Regrettable Mentions

#### Icons8

While the plugin is at first glance well made, it got a few issues that make it a non starter. Search is tagged and returns related icons, not just the direct search term. Infuriatingly though, it doesn't understand partial matches, so typing "para" will not return any results, you got to type it out. Included is a large amout of different icon sets, including a knockoff SF Symbols, an art deco style set among many others. Unfortunately the list doesn't have any previews, so it's hard to tell which ones are interesting.

The quality is mixed to put it gently. Inconsistent stroke widths, weird decisions and misalignments are common, I even spotted some errors. One time I scrolled really far and saw some Simpsons icons. Maybe that will come in handy some time. You also only get pixelated versions for free, but there are vector versions which you get with their $15 per month subscription.

#### Iconduck

I only know about them through them spamming the Figma plugin section, releasing plugin after plugin for every single icon set in existence. I spotted some icons with errors and for some reason the icon size you get depends on your current viewport zoom. Thankfully midway through testing they started begging me to enter my email and locked me out of all of their plugins.

## Community Files

Another way to get icons to use in projects apart from plugins are community files.

Using Icons

[^1]: At the time of writing, Google reports 3065 glyphs, when we multiply that with the three different styles (outlined, sharp, rounded), filled/not filled and the three parameters weight (7 steps), grade (three steps) and optical size (4 steps) we get a combined total of 2.795.280 possible glyphs. I have to admit, using a plugin is probably the easiest way to manage those. (3065\*2\*3\*(2^7+2^3+2^4))
