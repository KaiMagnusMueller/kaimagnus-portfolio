description: Tells the story of how the Aral Sea was drained for cotton plantations and other agriculture during the soviet era. Users can navigate through the drying process by removing water themselves in the form of blue acrylic sheets.
# descriptionLong: Formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world, the Aral Sea has been steadily shrinking since the 1960s. With this project, we want to give a comprehensive overview of the greatest man made intervention in history of nature. The project was awarded with the Digital Talents Award from the Annual Multimedia Awards 2018.

## Goal

The course Interactive Communication Systems I aims to provide a look into exhibition design. After initial research
into multiple topics, we were expected to choose one and present it to a user group of our choice. With this project we
wanted to educate children in school and their parents in an exhibition setting about the causes and solutions to the
sea's condition.

## A Man-Made Disaster

The Aral Sea between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world. In the early
20<sup>th</sup> century the Soviet government decided to irrigate the desert and grow rice, melons and cotton. The remaining water flowing into the Aral Sea could not match losses through evaporation and the sea began to shrink. By 1960 between 20km<sup>2</sup> and 60km<sup>2</sup> of water was diverted each year. In the 1970s the Aral Seas level fell by 50-60cm each year. By 2009 only its northern part and a small strip in the south remained.

The process of drying up the sea has left plains covered with salt and chemicals from weapon testing and industry,
pesticides and fertilizer. The region's fishing industry has been devastated which caused rising unemployment. Dust
storms are blowing toxic sand into settlements, causing serious public health issues.

## ASDF

The Aral Sea between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world. In the early
20th century the Soviet government decided to irrigate the desert and grow rice, melons and cotton. The remaining water
flowing into the Aral Sea could not match losses through evaporation and the sea began to shrink. By 1960 between 20km2
and 60km2 of water was diverted each year. In the 1970s the Aral Seas level fell by 50-60cm each year. By 2009 only its
northern part and a small strip in the south remained.

The process of drying up the sea has left plains covered with salt and chemicals from weapon testing and industry,
pesticides and fertilizer. The region's fishing industry has been devastated which caused rising unemployment. Dust
